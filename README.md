# Minetest Errata
## a mod that fixes small errors and omissions in other mods

By its nature, the mod is rather intrusive. It will actively try to alter and override existing node definitions and such.

### Issues the mod addresses:
* connectivity of xpanes - adds new groups for materials (e.g. sandstone) and allows panes to connect to them
    * the new groups are prefixed with "me_" to avoid potential conflicts
* erasing books back into clean books

### Introduces items
* obsidian glass panes
* paper walls, wooden bars
* wooden and steel bar doors
* sandstone cobble varieties, with stairs/slabs/microblocks, walls, pkarcs
* doors from moreblocks glass types (clean, iron, coal)
* locked glass doors (regular, obsidian, iron glass)

## Borrowed items

This mod can borrow some items from other mods (in cases where the whole mod seems to much, but some of its contents are definitely something that should have been in the game from the get go). So far the list of such mods is this:

* Mintest Game Plus by Wuzzy http://repo.or.cz/minetest_mtg_plus.git
    * paper walls and wooden bars
    * steel bar and wooden bar doors
    * sandstone cobble varieties
